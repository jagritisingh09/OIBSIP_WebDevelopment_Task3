             Project Title
  Temperature Converter — Task 3 (Web Development Internship)

Objective
•The goal of this project is to create an interactive temperature converter that allows users to convert between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin. The converter also displays a visual thermometer that changes color based on the temperature.

Files in this Repository
•temp.html → Main HTML structure for the converter.
•temp.css → Styling for layout, colors, and responsiveness.
•temp.js → JavaScript logic for live conversion and thermometer visualization.

Work Done
•Built a responsive input form for temperature values and unit selection.
•Implemented live conversion between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin.
•Added input validation to handle empty or invalid entries.
•Created a dynamic thermometer bar that changes color (blue for cold, green for moderate, red for hot).
•Styled the interface for a clean and modern look with background images and smooth transitions.

Tools Used
•HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
•Visual Studio Code (editor)
•Chrome Browser for testing

How to Run
1.Download or clone this repository.
2.Keep temp.html, temp.css, and temp.js in the same folder.
3.Open temp.html in any browser to use the converter.

Outcome
•Fully functional temperature converter with live visual feedback.
•User-friendly design suitable for desktop and mobile.
•Built entirely with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
